        <p>
            Neptune is the eighth and farthest known Solar planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
            fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17
            times the mass of Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and physically
            smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. The
            planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion
            mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the
            god Neptune's trident or the Greek letter psi.

            Internal structure
        </h2>
        <p>
            Neptune's internal structure resembles that of Uranus. Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and
            extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core, where it reaches pressures of about 10 GPa, or about
            100,000 times that of Earth's atmosphere. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found
            in the lower regions of the atmosphere.The mantle is equivalent to 10 to 15 Earth masses and is rich in
            water, ammonia and methane. As is customary in planetary science, this mixture is referred to as icy even
            though it is a hot, dense fluid. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a
            water–ammonia ocean.

            Atmosphere
        </h2>
        <p>
            At high altitudes, Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also
            present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared
            portion of the spectrum. As with Uranus, this absorption of red light by the atmospheric methane is part of
            what gives Neptune its blue hue, although Neptune's vivid azure differs from Uranus's milder cyan. Because
            Neptune's atmospheric methane content is similar to that of Uranus, some unknown atmospheric constituent is
            thought to contribute to Neptune's colour.

            Storms
        </h2>
        <p>
            In 1989, the Great Dark Spot, an anticyclonic storm system spanning 13,000 km × 6,600 km (8,100 mi × 4,100
            mi) was discovered by NASA's Voyager 2 spacecraft. The storm resembled the Great Red Spot of Jupiter. Some
            five years later, on 2 November 1994, the Hubble Space Telescope did not see the Great Dark Spot on the
            planet. Instead, a new storm similar to the Great Dark Spot was found in Neptune's northern hemisphere.The
            Scooter is another storm, a white cloud group farther south than the Great Dark Spot. This nickname first
            arose during the months leading up to the Voyager 2 encounter in 1989, when they were observed moving at
            speeds faster than the Great Dark Spot (and images acquired later would subsequently reveal the presence of
            clouds moving even faster than those that had initially been detected by Voyager2).
